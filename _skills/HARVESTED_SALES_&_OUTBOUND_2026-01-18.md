## 3. Protocol (numbered steps)
1. **Prospect Selection (10 min)**: Use Apollo.io or LinkedIn Sales Nav to filter 20 ICP-fit prospects who posted/changed jobs in last 30 days; note 1 unique detail per prospect (e.g., "Congrats on Acme launch").
2. **AI Personalization (15 min)**: Feed details into Claude/GPT prompt: "Write a 3-sentence cold email hook that references [detail], sparks curiosity about [your value prop], ends with yes/no question." Refine 1x for tone.
3. **Multi-Channel Deliver (30 min)**: Send LinkedIn connection req with AI hook as note → 2 min later, email with same hook + Calendly link → Record 15-sec Loom video reiterating hook, send via email reply.
4. **Cadence Automation (20 min)**: Set Clay/Instantly sequence: Day 2 LinkedIn follow-up comment on their profile/post; Day 4 phone/text via Klenty; Day 6 "breakup" email.
5. **Track & Triage (15 min)**: Log in Notion/G Sheets: opens/replies; prioritize 3 hottest leads for live call next day.

## 4. Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- Don't blast generic templates—always tie to recent activity or wastes 90% of sends.
- Don't skip video—text-only gets 70% lower reply rates per tests.
- Don't chase >7 touches—diminishing returns after Day 6.
- Don't prospect without ICP filter—leads to <1% pipeline velocity.
- Don't manual everything—AI skips save 2hrs/day but verify outputs.

### LinkedIn DM Outbound Workflow

**Source:** @JoshBraun

**Protocol:**
1. Identify 50 ICP prospects via LinkedIn Sales Navigator using advanced search filters (title, company size, recent activity).
2. Scroll their profile/activity feed for 30 seconds to spot a "pain signal" (e.g., post complaining about churn, funding round mention).
3. Send a connection request with a 1-sentence note: "Saw your post on [specific pain] – solved it at [your company]. Connect?"
4. If accepted (within 24h), DM immediately: "Quick question: Still dealing with [pain]? Here's how we fixed it for [similar company]. [Link to 90-sec loom video demo]."
5. No reply in 48h? Comment publicly on their latest post with value-add insight tied to pain, then re-DM.
6. Book call via Calendly link in final DM; track in CRM with "pain type" tag for nurture sequence.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Don't send generic connection requests or pitch-first DMs.
- Don't prospect without a recent activity signal (no "spray and pray").
- Don't use long emails/videos (>90 sec) or attach decks – keep it hyper-personalized and low-friction.

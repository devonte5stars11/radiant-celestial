# The 90/20/10 Productivity Protocol

**Source:** @SahilBloom

**Protocol:**
1. Block 90 minutes of uninterrupted deep work first thing in the morning (no notifications, phone in another room).
2. Follow with exactly 20 minutes of reactive tasks (email, Slack—use a timer, no multitasking).
3. End the cycle with 10 minutes logging wins/obstacles in a simple Notion template (one sentence each).
4. Repeat cycles 3x before lunch; adjust based on energy audit from prior day.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Don't check email/social before your first 90-minute block.
- Don't extend reactive time beyond 20 minutes—carry over to next cycle.
- Don't skip the 10-minute log; it compounds weekly insights.
- Don't do cycles back-to-back without a 5-minute walk break.

### Recursive Refinement Framework

**Source:** @SahilBloom

**Protocol:**
1. **Prime**: Spend 5 minutes freewriting everything you know about the topic (no research).
2. **Probe**: Identify 3-5 knowledge gaps from your prime output; research only those using 3 diverse sources.
3. **Pseudocode**: Rewrite the concept in your own "code" (simplified steps/pseudocode) as if teaching a 10-year-old.
4. **Perturb**: Teach it aloud to an imaginary skeptic; note breakdowns and refine pseudocode iteratively (3 rounds max).
5. **Prune & Stack**: Distill to 1-page cheat sheet; link to 2 existing mental models from other domains.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Starting with passive reading/videos (bypasses priming gaps).
- Researching broadly without gap-list (information overload).
- Skipping aloud teaching (hallucinated understanding).
- Hoarding notes without pruning/stacking (no retention).

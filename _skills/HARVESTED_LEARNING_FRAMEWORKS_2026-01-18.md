# The 3x3 Learning Matrix

**Source:** @SahilBloom

**Protocol:**
1. Select a topic and break it into a 3x3 grid: rows for Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced levels; columns for Understand/Apply/Synthesize.
2. Fill each cell with 1 micro-task (e.g., Beginner-Understand: Watch 10-min explainer video).
3. Time-box 90 minutes per row: complete Beginner row first, then Intermediate, then Advanced.
4. After each row, journal 1 insight linking to prior knowledge.
5. Review full matrix after 24 hours; iterate on weak cells with spaced repetition.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Skipping levels (e.g., jumping to Advanced without Beginner).
- Overloading cells with >1 task.
- No 24-hour review (leads to shallow retention).
- Ignoring journal links (misses compounding knowledge).

# The 321 Productivity Protocol

**Source:** @hubermanlab

**Protocol:**
1. **3-Minute Prime**: Start day with 3 minutes of deliberate deep breathing (e.g., physiological sigh: double inhale, long exhale) to reset nervous system.
2. **2-Hour Focus Block**: Dedicate next 2 hours to single highest-priority task; use non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) protocol (10-min body scan) if mind wanders.
3. **1-Hour Review & Stack**: End block with 1 hour reviewing output, stacking 3 micro-wins into a "momentum log," then schedule next day's 2-hour block.
4. Repeat 2-3 cycles daily, with 20-min walks between.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Multitasking during focus blocks (dilutes dopamine).
- Skipping the prime (leads to elevated cortisol).
- Extending blocks beyond 2 hours (triggers fatigue).
- Vague logging (must be 3 specific, quantifiable wins).

# The "Cascade Planning" System

**Source:** @AlexHormozi

**Protocol:**
1. List your top 3 outcomes for the day (specific, measurable).
2. Break each outcome into 3 micro-tasks (under 90 minutes each).
3. Assign a "cascade trigger": Complete task 1 of Outcome 1 before starting anything else.
4. Time-block in 90-minute sprints with 10-minute reviews: Log wins/blockers.
5. End day with 5-minute "chain audit": Rate completion (0-10) and carry over 1 unfinished task to tomorrow's top.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Multitasking across outcomes (finish cascade before switching).
- Vague tasks (no "work on X," only specifics like "write 500 words").
- Skipping reviews (no momentum without reflection).
- Overloading (never more than 9 micro-tasks total).

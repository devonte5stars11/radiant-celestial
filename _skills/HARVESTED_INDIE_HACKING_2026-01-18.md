## 1. 48-Hour AI-Powered Indie Product Validation Workflow

**Source (username):** @dannypostmaa

**Protocol (numbered steps):**
1. Identify a painful problem in a niche you know (e.g., via Reddit/IndieHackers forums) – 30 mins.
2. Prompt GPT-4 to generate 3 MVP ideas solving it with no-code tools (Carrd + Zapier + OpenAI API) – 15 mins.
3. Build a smoke-test landing page on Carrd with Stripe buy button for $19 pre-order – 45 mins.
4. Use Twitter/X ads + Reddit ads targeting niche ($50 budget) to drive 200 visitors – 30 mins setup, monitor 24 hrs.
5. Analyze signups/conversions via Stripe + Hotjar heatmaps; interview 5 buyers via Calendly – 60 mins.
6. If >5% conversion, ship MVP using Replit + Supabase in next 24 hrs; else pivot.

**Anti-patterns (what NOT to do):**
- Don't code a full product before validation (builds sunk cost fallacy).
- Don't rely on organic traffic only (too slow for iteration).
- Don't ignore buyer interviews (assumes you know customer pain).
- Don't scale ads beyond $50 without 5% baseline conversion.

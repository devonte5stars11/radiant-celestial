### 3. Protocol (numbered steps)
1. **Monday: Idea validation** - Post a 280-char product tweet with problem + solution sketch; aim for 50+ likes/replies in 24h. Kill if <20.
2. **Tuesday: MVP spec** - Use Notion/Figma to outline 3 core features max; timebox to 2h, no perfection.
3. **Wednesday-Thursday: Build** - Code only the 3 features using no/low-code (Bubble/Replit); deploy to Vercel/Netlify by EOD Thursday.
4. **Friday: Launch & share** - Tweet demo video (<60s) + waitlist/signup link; DM 20 target users from replies for beta access.
5. **Saturday: Collect data** - Track signups, feedback via Typeform (5 questions max); analyze churn signals.
6. **Sunday: Iterate or pivot** - Fix top 3 issues or kill/repurpose if <10 signups; log in public Notion dashboard.

### 4. Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- Don't build without pre-validation (avoids 80% waste).
- Don't scope >3 features (prevents "feature creep death").
- Don't launch without a video demo (tweets flop 90% without visuals).
- Don't ignore Sunday review (leads to repeated failures).
- Don't hide progress (public builds audience + accountability).

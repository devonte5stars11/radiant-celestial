### Engineering Leader's "Impact Audit" Workflow

**Source:** @willlarson (verified, 120k+ followers)

**Protocol:**
1. End of each quarter, list all team projects and your personal initiatives.
2. Score each on a 1-10 scale for "business impact" (revenue/users affected) and "team leverage" (skills gained/systems improved).
3. For items scoring <7 in either category, write a 1-paragraph "kill justification" or "pivot plan."
4. Share audited list in leadership sync; vote on top 3 to double down for next quarter.
5. Archive low-impact items publicly in team wiki with lessons learned.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Don't audit reactively (e.g., only during crises)—schedule quarterly.
- Don't let sacred cows slide; no exemptions for "pet projects."
- Avoid vague scores; mandate evidence (metrics/surveys) for justification.
- Never skip the public share/vote—hides accountability.

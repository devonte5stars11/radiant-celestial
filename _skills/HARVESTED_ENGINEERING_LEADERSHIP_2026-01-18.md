# Engineering OKR Cascade Protocol

**Source:** @gergelyorosz

**Protocol:**
1. **Company OKRs to Team OKRs (Week 1 Monday):** Translate top 3 company OKRs into 3-5 team OKRs using a 1-page template (Key Result must be measurable, e.g., "Reduce deploy time from 2h to 15min").
2. **Team OKRs to Individual OKRs (Week 1 Wednesday):** Hold 15-min 1:1s with each direct report; co-create 2-3 personal OKRs aligned to team ones, score confidence (1-10) and adjust.
3. **Weekly Check-in Sprint (Every Friday, 30-min team sync):** Review progress via shared Notion dashboard; vote on blockers (dot voting, top 3 escalated).
4. **Quarterly Rebalance (Day 1 of new quarter):** Audit OKRs against outcomes; kill under 70% achievers, redistribute load.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Setting vague OKRs like "improve code quality" without metrics.
- Cascading top-down without individual input (causes disengagement).
- Skipping weekly syncs (leads to siloed surprises).
- Retaining failing OKRs past midpoint (wastes Q effort).

# The 90-Minute Daily Content Engine

**Source:** @thejustinwelsh

**Protocol:**
1. **Capture (10 min):** Scroll your niche feed, note 5 raw ideas in a single Google Doc (title: YYYY-MM-DD Ideas).
2. **Cluster (15 min):** Group ideas into 3 themes using bullet points; pick the top theme with highest engagement potential (e.g., check past post data).
3. **Outline (20 min):** Expand top theme into 10 tweet thread skeleton: Hook + 8 value tweets + CTA.
4. **Write (30 min):** Flesh out thread in Twitter composer; use AI (e.g., Claude) only for grammar/expansion of 1-2 tweets.
5. **Visual + Schedule (15 min):** Add 1 custom Canva visual (quote graphic); schedule via Buffer for peak time (tool analyzes your audience).

**Anti-patterns:**
- Don't brainstorm from scratch—always pull from real conversations/data.
- Don't edit endlessly—ship imperfect threads to test.
- Don't post sporadically—commit to daily execution for compounding.

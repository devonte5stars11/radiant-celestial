### 3. Protocol (numbered steps)
1. **Audit (30 min):** Scroll your niche's top 10 accounts; note 5 problems they complain about but don't solve.
2. **Hook Batch (45 min):** For each problem, write 3 attention-grabbing hooks (question + promise format, e.g., "Tired of X? Here's Y that fixed it").
3. **Thread Skeleton (1 hr):** Build 1 thread per hook: Problem (1 tweet), 3-step solution (tweets 2-4), CTA (tweet 5). Use AI for first draft only.
4. **Visual + Repurpose (1.5 hr):** Add 1 custom meme/image per thread. Convert to: LinkedIn carousel (same text, 5 images), YouTube Short (voiceover top hook), Email snippet.
5. **Schedule & Track (15 min):** Post 1 thread/day via Buffer. Track views/engagements in Notion dashboard; kill underperformers after 48 hrs.

### 4. Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- Don't chase trends—stick to evergreen problems you can solve personally.
- Don't write long-form first—hooks die without them.
- Don't repurpose everything equally—only top 20% performers get multi-platform push.
- Don't edit endlessly—ship 80% done to test velocity.

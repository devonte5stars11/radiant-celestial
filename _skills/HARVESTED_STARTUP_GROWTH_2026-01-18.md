### 3. Protocol (numbered steps)
1. **Select 1 channel**: Pick your top-performing acquisition channel from the prior week (e.g., SEO, Twitter, referrals) based on LTV/CAC ratio.
2. **Pull raw data (15 mins)**: Export 7 days of analytics from Google Analytics/Mixpanel/Heap—focus on funnel drop-offs, conversion rates, and cohort retention for new users.
3. **Score experiments (20 mins)**: List 3 micro-experiments (e.g., "A/B test email subject lines"); score each 1-10 on effort vs. impact potential using ICE framework (Impact x Confidence / Ease).
4. **Run top experiment (45 mins)**: Implement the highest ICE scorer immediately (e.g., via no-code tools like Carrd for landing pages or Zapier for automations); launch to 10% of traffic.
5. **Document & schedule**: Log results in a Notion template with before/after metrics; set calendar reminder for next audit.

### 4. Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- Don't audit multiple channels—spreads focus thin.
- Don't rely on vanity metrics like impressions; stick to revenue-impacting ones.
- Don't skip data export for "gut feel" reviews.
- Don't let experiments run >1 week without auditing.
- Don't scale unproven experiments to 100% traffic.

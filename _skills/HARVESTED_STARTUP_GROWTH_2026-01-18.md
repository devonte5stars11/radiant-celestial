**Protocol:**  
1. **Day 1-7: Build audience atomic unit** – Post 1 daily Twitter thread solving 1 hyper-specific pain in your niche (e.g., "How I fixed Stripe billing errors in 17 lines"). End with a 1-question poll. Reply to all responses within 1 hour.  
2. **Day 8-14: Seed product teaser** – DM top 50 engagers from step 1 with a private Notion demo link of your MVP. Ask for 1 brutal feedback point. Iterate MVP daily based on 5+ responses.  
3. **Day 15-21: Launch micro-cohort** – Announce beta to engagers via Twitter Space (invite-only, 30 mins). Onboard 10 paying users at 50% discount. Ship 1 weekly update thread tagging them.  
4. **Day 22-30: Amplify retention loop** – Extract 3 testimonials into viral tweet carousels. Referral: Each user gets 1 free month per successful signup. Track MRR delta weekly via simple Airtable.

**Anti-patterns:**  
- Don't spray-and-pray mass DMs (use <100 hyper-targeted only).  
- Don't build in isolation (ship MVP before perfect, validate via engagers first).  
- Don't ignore replies/polls (>24h response kills momentum).  
- Don't chase vanity metrics (focus MRR over likes; no paid ads until $1k MRR).

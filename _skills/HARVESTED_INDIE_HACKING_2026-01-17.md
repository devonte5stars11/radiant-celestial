### 48-Hour Indie Launch Protocol

**Source:** @levelsio

**Protocol:**
1. **Hour 0-2:** Identify a personal pain point. Brainstorm 5 ideas solving it; pick the simplest with monetization potential (e.g., $10/mo subscription).
2. **Hour 2-6:** Build a one-page landing site on Carrd or Tipi with waitlist signup and fake door pricing. Include a Twitter embed for social proof.
3. **Hour 6-12:** Write and post a raw X thread explaining the problem, your solution, and link to landing page. Tag 10 relevant indie hackers. Aim for 100+ signups.
4. **Hour 12-24:** Analyze signups (who, why). Build MVP using Replit/Tauri for desktop or Bubble for web—no custom backend. Hardcode features from top feedback.
5. **Hour 24-36:** Integrate Stripe checkout (prebuilt templates). Test end-to-end with 3 beta users from waitlist.
6. **Hour 36-48:** Launch on Product Hunt, HN Show, and X with "live now" thread. Email waitlist with 50% off first month.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Don't market research for weeks—use your own itch.
- Don't build full features upfront—ship 80% incomplete.
- Don't polish UI/UX—focus on core value, ugly works.
- Don't solo-launch—leverage X amplification first.

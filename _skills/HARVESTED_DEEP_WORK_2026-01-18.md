# The 3-Phase Deep Work Vault

**Protocol:**
1. **Prep Phase (15 mins):** Clear desk, enable Do Not Disturb on all devices, set a single Outcome Goal (e.g., "Write 1,000 words on X"), play 1-hour binaural beats playlist.
2. **Execution Phase (90 mins):** Work in 25-min sprints x 3 with 5-min breathwork breaks (4-7-8 breathing); no tabs open except core tools; use analog timer.
3. **Seal Phase (10 mins):** Journal exact output vs. goal, note distractions attempted, archive session notes in Notion template for weekly review.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Multitasking tabs/emails during prep.
- Extending beyond 90 mins (causes burnout).
- Skipping journaling (erodes accountability).
- Working without pre-set Outcome Goal (leads to shallow busyness).

### Deep Work Timebox Ritual

**Source:** @SahilBloom

**Protocol:**
1. **Prime (5 mins):** Write a single-sentence "North Star" for the session (e.g., "Finish outline for Chapter 3") and place phone in a locked drawer 10ft away.
2. **Lock-in (90 mins):** Use a physical timer; work on *only* that task with browser extensions blocking all non-essential sites; no notes or breaks.
3. **Extract (10 mins):** Bullet-point key outputs and one lesson learned; rate focus 1-10.
4. **Repeat max 3x/day:** Space with 30-min walks; end day with 5-min review of total deep hours.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Starting without a hyper-specific North Star (leads to drift).
- Allowing "quick checks" (email/social = 40% focus loss).
- Sessions >90 mins (diminishing returns, burnout).
- Skipping Extract (no compounding improvement).

# Cal Newport's "Deep Work Timeblock Ritual"

**Source:** @calnewport

**Protocol:**
1. Schedule exact 90-minute blocks in your calendar for deep work, treating them as unbreakable appointments (e.g., 9-10:30 AM).
2. Pre-block: 5 minutes before start, perform a "shutdown ritual" – close all tabs, silence notifications, and write a single task on paper.
3. Execute: Work only on that one task using a "productive meditation" technique – verbalize thoughts aloud if stuck to maintain flow.
4. Post-block: 10-minute walk outside (no phone) for deliberate recovery, reviewing what worked.
5. Repeat max 4 blocks/day, separated by 30+ min buffers; log output in a simple tracker.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Multitasking or checking email/Slack during blocks.
- Extending blocks beyond 90 minutes (leads to fatigue).
- Skipping recovery walks (impairs next block quality).
- Relying on willpower without pre-scheduled blocks.

# 🦅 Habit Forge | Sovereign Sanctuary
**The Autonomous, Privacy-First Neural Rewiring Engine.**

## 🧐 Purpose & Philosophy
Habit Forge is not just a "habit tracker." It is a **Sovereign System** designed for high performers who refuse to rent their data. Unlike generic apps that store your habits in the cloud to train their algorithms, Habit Forge operates on a **Local-First** philosophy.

**Your Data. Your Grind. Your Sovereignty.**

### 💎 Key Benefits
-   **Zero Cloud Reliance**: All data lives in your browser's local storage or your JSON backups.
-   **Loss Aversion Gamification**: The system highlights "At Risk" streaks (completed yesterday, not today) to psychologically compel consistency.
-   **Visual Intelligence**: Analytics engine transforms your daily inputs into trend lines and consistency metrics.
-   **Frictionless Flow**: Keyboard-first navigation (`Cmd+K`) for rapid interaction.

## 🎮 How to Use
### 1. The Dashboard (`/`)
-   **Create Protocol**: Hit `+ New Protocol` (or `Cmd+K` -> "New Protocol") to define a new habit (e.g., "Deep Work 4h").
-   **Mark Complete**: Click the circle on the card to mark it as done for today.
-   **Track Streaks**: Watch your streak counter rise. If you miss a day, the counter resets. If you are "At Risk" (missed today but did yesterday), the card glows orange.

### 2. Analytics (`/analytics`)
-   **Visualize**: See your completion trends over the last 30 days.
-   **Metrics**: Track your "Total Active Protocols" and "High Score" streaks.

### 3. Settings & Sovereignty (`/settings`)
-   **Export Data**: Click "Export JSON" to download a full backup of your life's data. **Do this weekly.**
-   **Import Data**: Restore your state on a new device or browser.

# ⚔️ THE ULTIMATE HANDBOOK: Zero-Friction Autonomy

This is the only guide you need for **Zero-Click** operation.

## 1. ⚡ "Auto-Accept" (Google Antigravity)
To bypass the "Accept Command" dialogs in your IDE:

1.  **Use the Workflow**: Type `@[/ralph-turbo]` in the chat.
2.  **Why?**: This workflow has the `// turbo-all` flag, which authorizes global auto-acceptance for that session.
3.  **Result**: Commands run instantly. No clicks.

## 2. 🤖 "Hot Tasks" (Instant Orders)
To bypass editing JSON files:

```bash
# General Research (Skips build check)
npm run ralph -- "Research the top 3 AI trends for 2026 and save to TRENDS.md"

# Code Tasks (runs build check)
npm run ralph -- "Create a new component src/components/Hero.tsx with a blue gradient"
```

## 3. 🤝 sharing (The Friend Protocol)
To make your friend unmatched:

1.  **Send them this**:
    > "Run this to install the Ultimate System:"
    > `npx https://gist.github.com/... (Hosting install-ralph.mjs)`
    > *Or send them the `scripts/install-ralph.mjs` file directly.*

2.  **They run**:
    ```bash
    node install-ralph.mjs my-project
    cd my-project
    npm run ralph
    ```

## 4. 🛡️ Unbreakable Mode
*   **No Internet?** Ralph switches to Local (Ollama).
*   **No Ollama?** Ralph switches to Mock Mode (Self-Repair).
*   **Result**: The loop never crashes.

**Status**: **ZERO FRICTION.** 🌿🐲💎

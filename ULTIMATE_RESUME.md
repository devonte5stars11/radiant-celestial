# DEVONTE BROWN
**Sovereign Systems Architect & AI Engineer**
*Building self-evolving software systems that build themselves.*

## 🏆 THE "ULTIMATE" ARCHITECTURE
**Creator of the "Sovereign Sanctuary" Ecosystem**
*Engineered a self-evolving development platform that integrates Local-First Sovereignty with Real-Time AI Intelligence.*

### **Core Innovations**
*   **The Agent Arsenal**: Architected a library of 19 crystallized AI skills (Skills-as-Code) enabling autonomous agents to build, verify, and deploy software without human intervention.
*   **Self-Evolving Intelligence**: Built `SKILL_HARVESTER`, a meta-agent that monitors X (via Grok API) to autonomously discover, reverse-engineer, and integrate new engineering workflows into the system.
*   **The Platinum Trinity**: Designed a multi-model orchestration protocol routing tasks between Gemini (Planning), DeepSeek (Execution), and Claude (Polish) for 99.9% autonomous code quality.
*   **Sovereign Data Protocol**: Implemented a "Local-First" architecture using Zustand + CRDTs for decentralized, offline-first user data ownership.

## 🚀 FEATURED PROJECTS

### **Radiant Celestial (Habit Forge)**
*A sovereign, autonomous habit-tracking platform.*
*   **Architecture**: Built on Next.js 16 with a "Zero-Latency" local-first data layer.
*   **Intelligence**: Integrated `AI_ORACLE` for local LLM coaching and `GROK_PULSE` for real-time community trend analysis.
*   **Automation**: Features a "Night Shift" protocol (`RALPH_PROTOCOL`) where autonomous agents merge PRs and ship features while I sleep.
*   **GitHub**: `github.com/devonte5stars11/radiant-celestial`

### **Human Being Studio**
*A decentralized creative suite template.*
*   **Rescue Operation**: Systematically audited and Reforged a legacy repo using the `REPO_RESCUE` agent skill, upgrading it to modern standards in <10 minutes.
*   **Tech**: Vite, React, Supabase, Agent-Enabled.
